# Salary-Prediction-of-Newly-Joined-Employees

As a data analyst at TechWorks Consulting, my task is to create a machine learning model that can predict the salary of newly hired employees. The given data includes various features such as college name, city, role, previous CTC, experience, etc. I will approach this task by first preprocessing the data, including converting categorical variables into numerical data, handling missing values and outliers, and creating dummy variables for the "Role" feature. After cleaning the data, I will train and evaluate different regression models to predict the salary. The available ML model options for this task include linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression, among others. I will select the model with the best performance, considering accuracy and other evaluation metrics. To further improve the selected model's performance, I can explore techniques such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble methods
